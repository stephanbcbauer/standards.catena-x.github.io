## General updates / information

### DevSecOps

- Stack Updates
  - All environments, except of INT and BETA, have been updated to Kubernetes 1.24.6. BETA and INT haven't been
    updated
    due to technical reasons but will be updated soon too.
  - ArgoCD has been updated on all environments
    to [v2.4.18](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.4.18).

- Documentation Updates
  - TRG 5.02 has been updated. In section _README.md_ _Prerequisites_ and _TL;DR_ has been added.
  - TRGs has moved on [https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/) from Documentation to Developer Hub in the top navigation.

- Deprecate old Repositories  
  If you have forked your Eclipse-Tractusx product repository our Catenax-NG GitHub organization, we strongly recommend
  to mark the former product repository in the Catenax-NG GitHub organization as DEPRECATED in the description. Also
  open a ticket to System-Team and ask to set GH Team permission to read-only. This is just to avoid confusion in which
  repository to work.

- Call for Account Housekeeping: Please check your team for team members that might have been left Catena-X and
  cleanup (e.g. GH Teams).
