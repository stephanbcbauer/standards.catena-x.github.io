# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.


## How to deploy

This deploys through github actions!

## how to use locally


- `npm install` (only initialy needed)
- `npm start`

### Verify build before pushing remote

If there are any issues with wrong/outdated links, the github action will fail. To reduce the feedback loop, build it locally before pushing.

`npm run build`
