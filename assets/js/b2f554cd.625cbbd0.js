It will be organized by Catena-X association and the Eclipse Foundation. The timetable can be found [here](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/blog/community-days#what-awaits-you). Registration link is already open.\\n- If somebody wants to become a commiter they can contact the community to help with the election.\\n\\n## Open discussions\\n\\n- Making large changes the are only formatting (like introducing checkstlye) can be done in one pull request. But be sure not to include any other features, bugfixes and make your description straightforward that this only contains formatting. Be aware that you need to make an IP check if more than a 1000 lines are changed but there can be exceptions with this rule.\\n- Upgrading Postgresql Bitnami Helm chart from appVersion 14 to 15 is not working currently. An investigation is needed to determine if this is even possible. For the moment wiping the data and creating the database from scratch with new version is possible and should be feasable as in Catena-X we don\'t operate production environments and a managed database instance would make this effort much easier. A discussion about this topic can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sig-infra/issues/271).\\n- There are some issues regarding GitHub workflows using the default runners in the free plan. This occures usually running the helm lint and test workflow with a large chat with many objects that consume a lot of resources and take a lot of time to spin up and run. There were already indications that GitHub Enterprise will be enabled for the eclipse-tractusx organization that would enable to use runners with more CPU and memory resources. In the meantime it is suggested to disable as many dependencies in your default values.yaml file as possible without breaking the deployment and the runtime of your application. Another suggestion is to adjust the container resource requests as setting them too large could also interfere with the resource usage.\\n- Using Hashicorp applications can be still used as they are not direct dependencies for the products but for the future there must be some replacement/solution provided by the Catena-X Architecture board.\\n- There was an issue with Managed Identity Wallets product regarding token validation on the int environment. Onboarding of MiW in Portal works properly. Please make sure when a similar issue happens, open a discussion in the [Tractus-X chat](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#tools.tractus-x:matrix.eclipse.org) and open an issue in the relevant GitHub repository (this case for [MiW repo](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-identity-wallet/issues/new/choose)).\\n\\n## Session recording\\n\\n- You can find the\\n  recording [here](https://bcgcatenax.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunitiesofPractises/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FCommunitiesofPractises%2FShared%20Documents%2FCX%2DCoP%20DevSecOps%2FOffice%5FHours%5FRegular%5FRecordings%2F20231006%5FDevSecOps%2DBusiness%20Hours%2DRecording%2Emp4&referrer=SharePoint&referrerScenario=OpenFile)"},{"id":"Office Hours 2023-09-29","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-09-29","editUrl":"https://github.com/catenax-ng/catenax-ng.github.io/blog/2023-09-29-OfficeHours.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-29-OfficeHours.md","title":"Office Hours 2023-09-29","description":"General updates / information","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 29, 2023","tags":[{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"},{"label":"officehour","permalink":"/blog/tags/officehour"}],"readingTime":2.41,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"DevSecOps Team","title":"Your DevSecOps enabler","url":"https://github.com/catenax-ng","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100771185?s=200&v=4","key":"DevSecOps"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Office Hours 2023-09-29","title":"Office Hours 2023-09-29","authors":"DevSecOps","tags":["news","officehour"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2023-10-06","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-10-06"},"nextItem":{"title":"Office Hours 2023-09-22","permalink":"/blog/Office Hours 2023-09-22"}},"content":"## General updates / information\\n\\n### DevSecOps / System-Team\\n\\n- In catenax-ng organization we ran out of free Action minutes for private repositories.

Registration is still open and Eclipse members like committers get a discount. There will be talks from some members of the Tractus-X community.\\n\\n## Open discussions\\n\\n- On stable environment when helm charts are configured via ArgoCD some attribute characters (like \'$\') need to be escaped to properly work.\\n- Even though a product will not be part of the next release it is encouraged to start contributing to it\'s repository for many reasons. First of all it help committers in the review process with not overwhelming them before the weeks of the release. Also inactive repositories get archived or deleted after a period of time. Please take a look at the [how to contribute](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/oss/how-to-contribute#code) section to learn more.\\n- Dev ArgoCD performance was down. Keep in mind that the dev environment usually has a high load due to the many deployments.

The customer code is not being shared by others using Fix. Specifiy CVEs and languages get reference patches that can be applied. The model is trained at Veracode and not using external models like GPT 3.5. It helps shortening the development cycle as lots of steps can be skipped when iterating over security issues. Currently Java and C# languages are supported with Javascript and Python support coming shortly. The tool can be used az a CLI or implemented into any workflow.

It\\n    helps a lot to know who is opening the request to verify.\\n  - Be careful with sensitive data, like email addresses, provided in issues. When you request to onboard a new\\n    developer to our Catenax-ng organization. It\'s sufficient to provide the GH account name, there is no need for any\\n    email-address. Keep in mind, that these issues are public and can be read from everyone, even spam-bots.\\n- E2E-Testing Helm Chart: We encourage you to contribute to\\n  this [e2e-testing repository](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/e2e-testing/tree/main/charts/umbrella\\n  ).

It\\n  is impossible to commit to EF repositories/branches without being a committer. It has been also discussed with EF, and\\n  there is no way. So best practice is to fork the repository, create a branch where you can add your changes/code/etc.\\n  and open a PR from this branch to the upstream repository. Please avoid to merge the branch inside of the fork to the\\n  forks main branch. It\'s recommended to have a branch (main) which represents the current state of the upstream at any\\n  time.\\n- Discussion about opening IP checks when PR contains more than 1000 lines of changed code, even if the changes only\\n  belong to changed/added documentation. In the end, it\'s up to the committer to decide.

Q&A\\n   1. Question to security team regarding VeraCode and license scan: Is the license scan of VeraCode already aligned with Catena-X requirements -> Question was taken by security team, no answer yet\\n   1. When should the code base moved from tractusx to catenax-ng -> As soon as possible. Supported / Golden path is catenax-ng only\\n   1. Issue with VeraCode Intellij Integration. A collegue was not able to use it. Security collegue figured out that a permission was missing on VeraCode.\\n   1. How are Multi environment deployments done correctly -> Every new environment will provide its own argocd instance. You will define your application per environment on the environment argocd\\n   1. How do you work with Secrets and ArgoCD? -> Currently you send your secrets manually to us and we will apply it in your namespace. The vault integration is very close to finish, then you will be able to reference inside ArgoCD secrets from vault\\n   1. How to work with Helm dependencies? This was asked in context of how to seperate the catena-x specific helm chart and your product helm chart. The motivation for separation is to have not catena-x specific code in your repository -> There is no particular requirement to keep catena-x specifics out of your repository. Best practice might be to have a release process which removes all catena-x specific files (which would then also generate a documentation and other things)\\n1.
