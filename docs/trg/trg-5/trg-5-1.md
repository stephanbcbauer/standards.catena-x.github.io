## Description

All Catena-X/ Tractus-X components **must** be installable via Helm and meet following requirements:

- Helm chart **must** be released.
- Use appropriate versioning for `version` and `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml`.
- The released Helm chart **must** not contain any environment specific `values-xyz.yaml` files.
- Helm chart `values.yaml` file **must** contain all values the chart will expect.
- Helm dependencies have to be declared in `Charts.yaml` file.

## Why

### Released Helm Charts

Tractus-X components can only be used and bundled with other components of Tractus-X if there is a version of the
component with reliable content. This can only be achieved by creating a release of your Helm chart. Please refer to [_
How to release a Helm Chart_](../../guides/how-to-release-a-helm-chart.md) and [_How to be part of the Release Umbrella
Helm Chart_](../../guides/how-to-be-part-of-release-umbrella-helm.md).

### Versioning

Versioning is essential when it comes to releasing Helm charts. In an ideal world your chart Version (defined
in `version` inside `Chart.yaml`) match the application version (defined in `appVersion` inside `Chart.yaml`) which the
Helm chart will deploy. This makes it for users easier to get and idea what will be installed in which version. Please
refer also to [_TRG 5.03 - Version Strategy_](trg-5-3.md).

To achieve a proper versioning of your Helm chart keep in mind, that it shall not contain version information that could
change outside the Helm chart, e.g. conatiner image tags (→ don't use container image tag _latest_).

### The `value.yaml` File

The `values.yaml` file is essential for Helm charts. The file **must** contain all values the chart is expecting and there
**must** no other values files except of `values.yaml` file. Released Helm charts **must** contain only `values.yaml` file.

### Dependencies

If a Helm chart has dependencies to other Helm charts, e.g. PostgreSQL, these dependencies **must** be specified in
the `Charts.yaml` file. Do not use outdated `requirements.yaml`.
