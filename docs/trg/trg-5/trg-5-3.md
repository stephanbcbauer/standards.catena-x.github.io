## Description

Correct versioning is crucial when testing and deploying the application.
It helps identifying issues with the chart or the application image.
Upgrading or rolling back of the deployment would lead to problems without proper versioning.

For more details, see the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#charts-and-versioning)
There are two different version properties for a Helm chart:

- Chart version
- App version

### Chart version

It is located in the _Chart.yaml_ under the _version_ property.
It follows semantic versioning.
The version should be bumped every time the _Chart.yaml_ file or any file in the _templates_ directory is changed.

### App version

The default app version value is located in the _Chart.yaml_ file under the _appVersion_ property.
The format should follow semantic versioning as well, because the appVersion and the image tag of your
docker images should be aligned. This means, the _appVersion_ should be used in the templates as the default image tag
for the deployment/pod.
Every time the _appVersion_ property is upgraded the chart _version_ number should be bumped as well.
